## Development Approach

The project was developed following these principles:

1. **Modular Design**: Each feature is implemented as a separate function
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
3. **Accessibility**: Proper focus states and semantic HTML
4. **Performance**: Efficient animations and minimal DOM manipulation
5. **Maintainability**: Well-commented code with clear function names
6. **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes
7. **User Experience**: Smooth transitions and clear feedback

## Libraries and Frameworks

### Core Technologies
- HTML5 for semantic markup
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

### Animation Libraries
- GSAP for complex animations
- CSS animations for simple effects

### Audio/Visual Libraries
- Web Speech API for text-to-speech
- Lottie.js for lightweight animations

### Storage
- localStorage for client-side data persistence

## Browser Compatibility
