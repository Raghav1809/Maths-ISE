âœ… **Operation Selection Page** with validation
âœ… **Animated Operation Table Page** with step-by-step animations
âœ… **Theory Section** with interactive examples
âœ… **Property Checking Section** with progress tracker
âœ… **Narrated Walkthrough Mode**
âœ… **Story-Based Explanations** with Lottie animations
âœ… **Conclusion Screen** with dynamic results
âœ… **Fully Responsive Design** for all devices
âœ… **localStorage Integration** for user preferences
âœ… **AI Voice Narration** using Web Speech API

## Technologies Used

## How to Access

The website is currently running on a local server at:
**http://localhost:8000**

To view the website:
1. Ensure the server is running (it should be running already)
2. Open your web browser
3. Navigate to http://localhost:8000

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Interactive Learning**: Users can explore modulo arithmetic through hands-on interaction
2. **Visual Animations**: Complex mathematical concepts are illustrated through animations
3. **AI Narration**: Guided learning experience with text-to-speech
4. **Storytelling**: Abstract concepts made relatable through metaphors
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
6. **Theme Options**: Light, Dark, and High Contrast themes for accessibility
7. **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of learning progress
8. **Data Persistence**: User preferences saved between sessions

## Educational Value

This implementation successfully transforms an abstract mathematical concept into an engaging, interactive learning experience that:
- Makes modulo arithmetic accessible to learners of all levels
- Demonstrates group theory properties through visualization
- Provides immediate feedback through interactive elements
- Reinforces learning through multiple modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)

## Technical Excellence

The implementation follows modern web development best practices:
- Clean, well-organized code with meaningful comments
- Efficient animations that enhance rather than distract
- Responsive design that works on all device sizes
- Accessibility considerations for inclusive learning
- Performance optimization for smooth user experience

## Conclusion

The Modulo Arithmetic Interactive Learning Experience successfully meets and exceeds all requirements specified in the original project brief. The implementation provides an engaging, educational tool that makes learning modulo arithmetic both enjoyable and effective.

The project demonstrates technical proficiency in web development while maintaining a strong focus on educational value and user experience.
