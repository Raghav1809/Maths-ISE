  - [x] Closure Property
  - [x] Associativity
  - [x] Identity
  - [x] Inverse Property
- [x] Animated mini-examples (mini tables or number line graphics)
- [x] Voice-over

### 6. Property Checking Section
- [x] Sequentially check and visually demonstrate:
  - [x] Closure Property
  - [x] Associative Property
  - [x] Identity Property
  - [x] Inverse Property
- [x] Each property section shows:
  - [x] Short definition at top
  - [x] Detailed verification with set elements
  - [x] Animated application on elements
  - [x] Colored highlights for valid and invalid cases
- [x] Manual progression through properties with story explanations
- [x] Property Progress Tracker
- [x] Display a horizontal progress bar showing each property check
- [x] Green for passed, Red for failed
- [x] If a property fails → immediately jump to the Conclusion screen
- [x] AI Voice Narration at each stage

### 7. Narrated Walkthrough Mode
- [x] On the first website visit, automatically start a guided walkthrough
- [x] Highlights each section with a semi-transparent overlay and narration
- [x] "This is the operation selector."
- [x] "Here's where your modulo table will appear."
- [x] "Now we'll test the four group properties."
- [x] User can skip or replay the walkthrough anytime

### 8. Story-Based Explanation
- [x] Each group property shown with a short educational story or metaphor:
  - [x] Closure → "All friends stay within the circle."
  - [x] Associativity → "Everyone teams up properly."
  - [x] Identity → "There's one neutral member who keeps balance."
  - [x] Inverse → "Each friend has a partner that balances them out."
- [x] Animated characters or icons represent these ideas (using Lottie animations)
- [x] Voice explains each part with simple narration

### 9. Conclusion Screen
- [x] Dynamic result message:
  - [x] "This set under the chosen modulo operation forms a Group!"
  - [x] "This set does not satisfy all group properties."
- [x] Animated property summary:
  - [x] Green tick for passed
  - [x] Red cross for failed
- [x] Confetti or spark animation when all properties hold
- [x] Buttons: "Restart", "Try Another Set", "Rewatch Animation"
- [x] AI Voice

## Design & Aesthetic Guidelines

- [x] Use TailwindCSS for layout, spacing, typography, and theming
- [x] Color palette: cool tones (blue, violet, white) for light mode
- [x] Deep navy and cyan for dark mode
- [x] Rounded cards, soft shadows, and subtle hover effects
- [x] Include Theme Toggle accessible from every page
- [x] Smooth transitions between pages (using GSAP)
- [x] Fully responsive with adaptive controls for mobile

## Technical Details
